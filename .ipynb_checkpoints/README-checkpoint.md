# Crop Yield Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts crop yields based on environmental factors such as weather and soil conditions. By using data on climate, soil, and crop management, the model will help farmers optimize planting and improve productivity.

## Timeline

This is a 2-week project focused on building a basic prediction model using regression techniques.

## Data Sources

- **Crop Yield Data**: FAO, USDA
- **Weather Data**: WorldClim, NOAA
- **Soil Data**: ISRIC SoilGrids
